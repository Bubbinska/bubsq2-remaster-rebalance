# Bubs' Q2 Remaster Rebalance

This repo is for my changes to the Quake2 re-release code for my mod, which you can download here https://www.nexusmods.com/quake2/mods/27

This mod makes some changes to weapon and enemy balance and otherwise attempts to make the single-player game fresh and interesting for veteran strogg slayers. 

I'll try to keep the nexusmods page updated with a full feature list but here's the broad strokes of what I'm gonna try to do:

1. Try to make all the weapons (sans blaster) still kinda useful situationally and not being totally supplanted by upgrades
2. Try to make some enemies more interesting to fight
3. Randomize some elements in the game so there's some variety every time you play

The big project I'm hoping to achieve for the next update is Quirks! Random enemy enchantments that cause you some confusion, discomfort or pleasure. The current version has "Chonkers", a bigger and tougher guy who emits light. 

Planned Quirks:

* Speedster: A faster, smaller enemy
* Splitter: Kill it and two tiny ones appear!
* Sploder: Goes bang when killed
* Screamer: Alerts nearby monsters
* Stranger: Changes the weapon somehow

To install:

Drop the "bubsq2" folder in your \Quake 2\rerelease folder

To play:

Load up the game and enter "game bubsq2" into console. 

Known issues:
None, but I haven't done significant playtesting.
