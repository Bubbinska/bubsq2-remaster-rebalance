# Bubs' Q2 Remaster Rebalance

This repo is for my changes to the Quake2 re-release code for my mod, which you can download here https://www.nexusmods.com/quake2/mods/27

This mod makes the following changes to weapons:

Shotgun: Slightly wider spread, slightly more damage per pellet, increased rate of fire (1.5x)

Super Shotgun: More pellets, less damage per pellet, overall damage remains the same

Machinegun: Half spread so more reliable for ranged pickoffs

Grenade Launcher: 120 -> 150 damage, slightly lower radius, slightly increased rate of fire (1.2x)

Hand Grenade: slightly higher radius damage

Railgun: 100 -> 150 damage

I'd like to make some more changes in future, but these ideas are more ambitious and will require a lot more work.

To install:

Drop the "bubsq2" folder in your \Quake 2\rerelease folder

To play:

Load up the game and enter "game bubsq2" into console. 

Known issues:
None, but I haven't done significant playtesting.
